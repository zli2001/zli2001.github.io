Solving the deploying problem.
<!--more-->
## Error
While I push my hugo project to github, action deploying went wrong:
{{< admonition failure "Error" >}}
 ![Liquid](Liquid.png "Liquid Exception")
{{< /admonition >}}



## Code

## Solve the problem


{{< admonition note "Note" >}}
{{< version 0.2.0 changed >}}

Install **hugo-extend** instead of hugo to support sass.

**OR** if you don't want to:
1. delete these two rows

2. (add a space between them):

{{< /admonition >}}

## Trouble Shooting
There is problem description on the [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/troubleshooting/#configuration-problems) pages but not solution.

And [add a.nojekyll](https://gitee.com/help/articles/4136#article-header1) doesn't work for my case.
